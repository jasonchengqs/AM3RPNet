# Layer-wise Prediction of Energy and Time Usage in Additive Manufacturing with Multimodal Neural Network
### Proposed model: Additive Manufacturing Multi-Modal Resource Prediction Network (AM3RPNet)

### Usage:
1. Download r3dim dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gergoszemeti/r3dim-resource-use-in-fdm-3d-printing.
2. Run preprocess.sh in scripts/ to extract timeseries and slice images.
3. Run scripts in scripts/ to train different models.
